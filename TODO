 Clustering
 - threshold for CH/CM trigger reelection (create a clusterHealthTimer)
    * after p% of vehicles in neighbor list are not in cluster table
 
 
 Election
 - some mechanism to decide whether to join election
 - leader msg -> send cluster table
 - on leader msg rcv -> init cluster table
 - could add cluster table (or just new joiners) to heartbeat
 
 
 Learning
  - reward
  - redo observation/action input/output:
	 - observation:
		 - neighbor table
		 - cluster table
		 - neighbor connectivity %
	 - action:
		 - join election weights (score election holders)
		 - score neighbor weights for election
		 - threshold % for reelection call
 
 Aggregation
 CM -> CH
 CH -> RSU
